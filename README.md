# AI-Powered-Mental-Health-Solutions
Our project is dedicated to supporting individuals who express their thoughts and feelings on social media, particularly those who may be experiencing mental health challenges like depression or anxiety. By analyzing these posts, we aim to identify signs of distress and offer compassionate, supportive responses. Our approach combines advanced language understanding models with techniques that capture the flow and emotion of written text. Through careful training, our system learns to recognize patterns associated with various mental health conditions. When a post indicates potential distress, our system gently rephrases the content to be less triggering, while preserving the original message, and includes relevant helpline information to provide immediate support. We prioritize ethical considerations by ensuring user privacy through data anonymization and secure handling. We also respect individuals' autonomy by analyzing publicly available data or obtaining consent when necessary. Additionally, we strive to reduce biases in our algorithms to prevent misclassification and ensure fair treatment for all users. By adhering to principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, justice, and beneficence, we aim to responsibly leverage AI to support mental health care, prioritizing user well-being and equitable access to resources
**Model Architecture:**
**BERT-LSTM Hybrid Model:**
Feature Extraction: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model to capture deep contextual language features.
Sequential Processing: Employs a bidirectional LSTM layer with a hidden size of 128 to understand the temporal patterns and emotional nuances in text.
Classification: A fully connected layer outputs probabilities indicating specific mental health conditions.
**Training Methodology:**
Trained over 15 epochs using a cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5.
BERT layers are frozen to maintain computational efficiency.
NaN values in the dataset are replaced with empty strings to ensure data integrity.
Achieved a final training accuracy of 77.52% and a cross-entropy loss of 0.6401.
**Generative Text Feed Generation:**
Upon classification, the system rephrases input text to reduce triggering content while preserving the original intent.
Incorporates relevant helpline numbers into the rephrased text to provide users with immediate access to professional support.
Ethical Considerations:
**Data Privacy:** Ensures user data is anonymized and securely handled to protect confidentiality.
Informed Consent: Analyzes publicly available data or obtains consent where necessary to respect user autonomy.
Bias Mitigation: Implements strategies to reduce algorithmic biases, preventing misclassification and ensuring fair treatment across diverse populations.
Ethical Principles: Adheres to principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, justice, and beneficence to responsibly leverage AI in mental health care.
